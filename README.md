# GPS_Game

A GPS-based mobile game developed for the Croatian Natural History Museum during my time at Gamechuck. The game combines exploration, trivia, and interactive minigames to create an engaging educational experience.

# How It Works:
- Choose Your Adventure:
  At the beginning of the game, players can select a location to discover. If undecided, the game calculates the nearest location and chooses it for them.

- Compass Navigation:
  Once a location is selected, players are guided by a compass screen that points in the direction of the destination and shows the distance to it.

- Complete the Challenge:
  When players reach the destination, a wheel of fortune spins, leading to either trivia questions or fun minigames to complete the adventure.

# Challenges Faced:
The most complex part of this project was implementing the compass functionality. It involved accurately calculating directions and resolving how Android devices detect True North based on the phone's sensors.

This project demonstrates my ability to develop location-based games, solve complex technical challenges, and create meaningful player experiences.
